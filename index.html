									<h2>Yoda</h2>
									<p>
										<img src="assets/images/yoda2.png" width="100%" height="100%">
										<br>Yoda, a male member of a mysterious species, was a revered Jedi Master who served as the Grand Master of the Jedi Order in the waning days of the Galactic Republic. He was renowned within the Order for his wisdom, powers of the Force, and lightsaber combat, and he lived for nearly 900 years. His time during the last days of the Jedi Order and beyond made him a consequential figure in galactic history.
										<br><br>
										Yoda sat on the Jedi High Council. During the Invasion of Naboo, Master Qui-Gon Jinn presented a young slave boy, Anakin Skywalker. Qui-Gon professed his belief that Skywalker was the Chosen One who would bring balance to the Force. At the same time, it was discovered that the Sith, the age-old enemies of the Jedi, had not gone extinct as the Jedi believed they had. Against Yoda's advice, the Jedi Council agreed that Obi-Wan Kenobi, who became a Jedi Knight after the death of his master, Jinn, could train Skywalker as a Jedi. Ten years later, Yoda presided over the Jedi Order as the Republic found itself on the road to war with the Confederacy of Independent Systems, led by Yoda's former apprentice, the fallen Jedi Count Dooku. Yoda led a clone army that had been secretly built for the Republic to Geonosis to save Kenobi, Skywalker, and Senator Padmé Amidala from Separatist captivity, and the ensuing battle—in which Yoda fought his former apprentice and forced the count to flee—sparked the Clone Wars between the Republic and the Separatists.
										<br><br>
										The Jedi Council took over leadership of the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars, making Yoda one of the leading Jedi Generals. He personally fought in some engagements in the war, including a battle with the Sith acolyte Asajj Ventress and her Separatist forces on Rugosa, but mostly commanded troops from afar. Towards the end of the war, Yoda was contacted by the spirit of the long-dead Qui-Gon Jinn, who told him that, contrary to Jedi teaching, it was possible to maintain one's consciousness after death. Yoda went on a spiritual journey where he underwent a series of trials, put forward by a group of mysterious Force Priestesses, to determine whether he was worthy to learn the secrets of immortality. This journey brought him to the world powerful with the Force, as well as Moraband, the ancient homeworld of the Sith. Yoda was deemed worthy, and Jinn began to teach him how to unlock this ancient and forgotten power.
										<br><br>
										As the Clone Wars came to an end, it was discovered that Supreme Chancellor Palpatine was, in truth, the Dark Lord of the Sith known as Darth Sidious, who the Jedi Council had been searching for ever since the Battle of Geonosis. When Yoda was commanding troops during the Battle of Kashyyyk, members of the Jedi Council attempted to arrest the chancellor, but Sidious struck them down and seduced Skywalker, now Darth Vader, to the dark side of the Force. This sparked the fall of the Jedi Order, with clone troopers across the galaxy given the command to kill their Jedi Generals. Yoda survived the attempted execution and escaped from Kashyyyk. Along with Kenobi, he became one of the few survivors of the fall of the Jedi Order, and he witnessed Sidious transform the Republic into the Galactic Empire. Yoda attempted to confront and defeat the Emperor, but Yoda was forced to retreat. After the secret birth of Vader's twins, Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa, Yoda helped arrange for the children to be hidden from their father and then went into exile on Dagobah.
										<br><br>
										Yoda remained in exile for over two decades. During his exile, he watched from afar as other Jedi survivors continued to operate throughout the galaxy, giving guidance to Jedi such as Kanan Jarrus and his Padawan, Ezra Bridger. During the Galactic Civil War, Luke Skywalker came to Dagobah at the urging of Kenobi, who had been struck down by Vader but used the secrets also given to him by Qui-Gon Jinn to retain his consciousness. Yoda was reluctant to train the boy, but he began to instruct him in the ways of the Jedi. Luke left Dagobah in order to save his friends on Cloud City, but he returned many months later to complete his training. By that time, Yoda had fallen ill and was near-death, but he lived long enough to confirm a truth that Luke had learned on Cloud City: Darth Vader was his father. Yoda uttered his final words, that there was another Skywalker—Leia—and slipped away into the Force. He appeared as a spirit, alongside the spirits of Kenobi and a redeemed Anakin Skywalker, after the Alliance to Restore the Republic defeated the Emperor and emerged victorious in the Battle of Endor.
										<br><br>
										After Yoda's death, Luke fulfilled his master's dying wish: to pass on what he had learned to a new generation of Jedi. Luke's attempt to restore the Jedi Order failed, however, when his nephew, Ben, fell to the dark side and destroyed the new generation of Jedi. Luke went into exile, but a young Force-sensitive scavenger named Rey later found herself on a quest to find the legendary Jedi Master and bring him back into the fight against the dark side. During her quest, she had a vision of the past and heard Yoda's voice in it, saying that the Force was a powerful energy that surrounded all life in the galaxy.

									<h2>Princess Leia</h2>
									<p>
										<img src="assets/images/leia2.png" width="50%" height="50%">
										<br>Leia Organa (born Leia Amidala Skywalker) was a Force-sensitive human female who served as princess of Alderaan, a member of the Imperial Senate, a leader in the Alliance to Restore the Republic and New Republic, and the founding general of the Resistance. Through it all, she became instrumental in the defeat of the Galactic Empire in the Galactic Civil War and led the fight against the First Order. She was born nineteen years before the Battle of Yavin as the daughter of Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and Senator Padmé Amidala. After her mother died and her father fell to the dark side of the Force to become Darth Vader, Leia was adopted by the House of Organa. She took the place of her adoptive father, Bail Organa, in the Senate and helped lead the fight against the Empire.
										<br><br>
										During the war with the Empire, Organa was entrusted with the stolen plans to the Death Star, an Imperial superweapon capable of destroying entire planets. She also met and became friends with Luke Skywalker—who, unknown to either of them, was her twin brother—Han Solo, and Chewbacca, who helped her escape from captivity on the Death Star and return the stolen plans to the Rebellion. After the Death Star was destroyed during the Battle of Yavin, Organa continued to help lead the war effort and coordinate the operations of the Alliance. After the Battle of Hoth, Vader captured Organa and Solo on Cloud City to use them as bait to lure Skywalker there. Solo, with whom Organa had fallen in love, was captured by the bounty hunter Boba Fett, but the others managed to escape and rejoin the Alliance Fleet. Not long after, Organa aided in the successful rescue of Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt, in which she killed the crime lord and earned the title of "Huttslayer." Following Solo's rescue, she participated in the Battle of Endor as part of General Solo's team, with the objective of destroying the Death Star's shield generator. During the campaign, Organa learned that Vader was her father, and Skywalker her brother. Vader and the Emperor, Darth Sidious, perished during the battle.
										<br><br>
										The Battle of Endor left the Empire in chaos, and Organa assisted in the formation of the New Republic. When the war came to a close, Organa disagreed with the Republic's decision to disarm its military, believing that the remnants of the Empire could not be trusted to follow the peace treaty it signed with the Republic. During this time, Organa and Solo were married and had a child, Ben Solo. The boy struggled with the dark side and Organa sent him to be trained by Skywalker as part of a new generation of Jedi, but Ben turned against his uncle and destroyed the new Jedi, taking on the name Kylo Ren and becoming an apprentice of Snoke, the Supreme Leader of the First Order. Organa urged the Republic to take the threat of the First Order seriously and she formed the Resistance, an unofficial military group secretly funded by the Republic, when the Galactic Senate chose to ignore her warnings. After the Resistance destroyed the First Order superweapon known as Starkiller Base, an operation that resulted in Solo's death at the hands of their son, Organa sent a young Force-sensitive named Rey, who had helped destroy the Starkiller weapon, to find Skywalker and bring him back from his self-imposed exile to help save the galaxy.

										<h2>Han Solo</h2>
										<p>
											<img src="assets/images/han.JPG" width="50%" height="50%">
											<br>Han Solo was a human male smuggler who became a leader in the Alliance to Restore the Republic and an instrumental figure in the defeat of the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War. He hailed from Corellia and became a smuggler in the employ of Jabba the Hutt, even completing the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs with his prized ship, the Millennium Falcon. He was the son-in-law of fallen Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and Senator Padmé Amidala, husband of Leia Organa, brother-in-law of Luke Skywalker, father of Ben Solo, rivals and close friends with fellow smuggler Lando Calrissian, and best friends with the Wookiee Chewbacca, his trusted co-pilot who swore a life debt to the Corellian smuggler. Solo ran afoul of Jabba after ditching a shipment of spice to avoid trouble with the Empire, owing the Hutt a great deal of money as a result. His fortune seemed to have changed when he agreed to charter Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO to Alderaan, but he became caught up in the rebellion against the Empire and, after helping Princess Leia Organa escape from the Death Star, briefly fought in the Battle of Yavin, which allowed Skywalker to destroy the superweapon. Solo fought with the Rebellion for a number of years afterward, taking part in numerous operations and battles against the Empire.
											<br><br>
											After the Battle of Hoth, Solo sought safe refuge with Organa—with whom he had fallen in love—Chewbacca, and Threepio on Cloud City, which was operated by his old friend Lando Calrissian. There, they were captured by the Sith Lord Darth Vader as part of a trap to bait Skywalker to the city. Solo was frozen in carbonite and taken to Jabba's Palace on Tatooine by the bounty hunter Boba Fett, where he remained encased in carbonite for months until he was rescued by his friends. After returning to the Alliance Fleet, Solo was promoted to the rank of general and was given command of the Pathfinders, a special forces squad, for the Battle of Endor. Solo led the Pathfinders to Endor, where he, Organa, Chewbacca, and the special forces team, with the help of the native Ewoks, destroyed the shield generator protecting the second Death Star that was being constructed in orbit. Their actions allowed the Alliance Fleet to destroy the superweapon.
											<br><br>
											The Battle of Endor, which saw the deaths of the Emperor and Darth Vader, allowed the Rebellion to form the New Republic. In the early days after Endor, Solo continued to lead the Pathfinders against the Empire. He married Organa, and the two had a son, Ben Solo. The boy struggled with the dark side of the Force—like his mother, who was the daughter of Darth Vader and twin sister of Luke Skywalker, Ben was Force-sensitive—so Organa sent him to be trained by Skywalker. He was seduced to the dark side by Snoke, Supreme Leader of the First Order, and destroyed Skywalker's attempt to rebuild the Jedi Order. Having lost their son, Solo left and returned to smuggling, and even lost the Millennium Falcon to numerous thieves. He continued to smuggle until he was brought back into the fight by a scavenger named Rey and a defected First Order stormtrooper named Finn, who carried with them a droid, BB-8, that had part of a map to Skywalker's location. Solo, who retrieved the Falcon from Rey and Finn, returned to Organa, who led the Resistance against the First Order, and fought in the battle to destroy the First Order superweapon known as Starkiller Base. During the battle, Solo saw his son, who had taken the name Kylo Ren, and tried to convince him to return home. Instead, Kylo stabbed his father with his lightsaber. Mortally wounded, Solo fell to his death in the bowels of the Starkiller weapon.

										<h2>Luke Skywalker</h2>
										<p>
											<img src="assets/images/luke.PNG" width="80%" height="80%">
											<br> Luke Skywalker was a human male Jedi Master who was instrumental in defeating the Galactic Empire and the Sith during the Galactic Civil War. He was the son of the redeemed Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and Senator Padmé Amidala, the grandson of Shmi Skywalker Lars, the grandson of both Ruwee Naberrie and Jobal Naberrie, the step-nephew of Owen and Beru Lars, the twin brother of Leia Organa and the uncle of Ben Solo. Luke and his sister were born in 19 BBY on the asteroid Polis Massa, unbeknownst to their father; the recently christened Sith Lord Darth Vader. After his mother died during labor, Luke was separated from his sister and taken by Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi to the planet Tatooine to be raised by the Lars family, out of sight of the Galactic Empire.
											<br><br>
											Luke grew up unaware of his origins, but his life changed forever with his uncle's purchase of two droids—R2-D2 and C-3PO—carrying plans to the Imperial Death Star superweapon. After his aunt and uncle were killed by Imperial troops searching for the plans, Skywalker embarked on a journey to deliver the plans to the Rebel Alliance, receiving training in the ways of the Force from Kenobi, and meeting Han Solo and (unbeknownst to him) his sister, Princess Leia Organa, a member of the Rebellion. Though Kenobi was killed by Vader, Skywalker participated in the Battle of Yavin alongside the Rebels with guidance from Kenobi's spirit, and managed to destroy the Death Star.
											<br><br>
											As a member of the Rebel Alliance, Skywalker and the Rebels evaded Imperial forces led by Vader, who hunted Skywalker relentlessly over the next three years. As the Rebels were forced to abandon their base during a battle on the snow planet Hoth, Skywalker flew to the swamp planet of Dagobah at the posthumous advice of his late mentor, Kenobi, where he received Jedi training from the exiled Jedi Master Yoda. However, Skywalker was lured into a trap by Vader at Cloud City on Bespin, where he engaged the Sith Lord in a lightsaber duel, discovering Vader's identity as his father and losing his hand in the process.
											<br><br>
											One year later, after freeing Han Solo from the clutches of crime lord Jabba the Hutt on Tatooine, Skywalker fought in the Battle of Endor before surrendering himself to Vader, realizing he had to confront his father and the Galactic Emperor, Sheev Palpatine, who was also the Sith Lord Darth Sidious. Though Sidious attempted to convert Skywalker to the dark side of the Force, Skywalker declared himself a Jedi and successfully appealed to the good in Vader, who redeemed himself as Anakin Skywalker by destroying Sidious at the cost of his own life. Thanks to Skywalker, the battle ended in a Rebel victory, and he joined his celebrating allies on Endor.
											<br><br>
											After the fall of the Empire, Luke founded a new Jedi temple in an attempt to rebuild the Jedi Order. However, he was betrayed by his apprentice and nephew Ben Solo, the man who would become Kylo Ren, who killed the rest of Luke's Padawans and joined the dark side under the mysterious Snoke. Blaming himself, Luke disappeared and withdrew from the galaxy, going on a quest to find the first Jedi temple. Years later, Luke was found by the Force-sensitive scavenger Rey, who followed a map to him left in fragments with R2-D2 and Lor San Tekka.

										<h2>Anikin Skywalker</h2>
										<p>
											<img src="assets/images/anakin.PNG" width="80%" height="80%">
											<br> Anakin Skywalker was a Force-sensitive human male who served the Galactic Republic as a Jedi Knight and later the Galactic Empire as the Sith Lord Darth Vader. Believed to have been conceived by the Force, he was born to Shmi Skywalker and came to reside on the Outer Rim planet of Tatooine as a small child, where he and his mother were slaves of the prominent crime lord Gardulla the Hutt before falling into the ownership of a local Toydarian junk dealer named Watto. An engineering prodigy, Skywalker rebuilt the protocol droid C-3PO using scavenged parts to help his mother. Soon thereafter, during the Naboo Crisis, he was discovered by Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi, who freed Anakin from slavery after a successful wager on the youth's podracing skills. Bringing him into the Jedi Order, Jinn hailed Skywalker as the Chosen One of Jedi prophecy, destined to defeat the Sith and bring balance to the Force.
											<br><br>
											In the years leading up to the Separatist Crisis, Skywalker was apprenticed to Obi-Wan Kenobi. Following the events of the Battle of Geonosis—the opening engagement which sparked the devastating, galaxy-wide conflict known as the Clone Wars—Skywalker secretly married his childhood love, Senator Padmé Amidala of Naboo. As the war progressed, Skywalker saw very little of Amidala, prizing the moments the two were able to share with one another. Early in the course of the war, the Jedi High Council assigned Skywalker a Padawan of his own, Ahsoka Tano, a gifted student who, much to Skywalker's chagrin, eventually left the Order before the war's end.
											<br><br>
											Towards the end of the war, Skywalker was blessed with the news of impending fatherhood when Amidala announced she was pregnant with his child. This blissful moment proved to be short-lived, however, as Skywalker became plagued with visions of his wife's demise in childbirth. In a misguided attempt at saving the lives of Amidala and their unborn child, Skywalker was driven to the dark side of the Force and ultimately betrayed his fellow Jedi by pledging himself to the teachings of his former confidant and friend, Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine—the public guise of the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious—who rechristened him Darth Vader. In a swift sequence of events, Palpatine officially ended the war, destroyed the Jedi Order, and proclaimed himself Galactic Emperor.
											<br><br>
											To put an end to the Clone Wars, Darth Vader was tasked with the elimination of the Separatist leadership, who had gone into hiding on the planet Mustafar. Shortly after completing his mission, Vader was confronted by his wife, Amidala, who attempted to persuade him to turn away from the dark side and run away with her. Believing Amidala had betrayed him when his former master, Kenobi, emerged from her ship, he attacked her before engaging in a duel against Kenobi. Ultimately, Kenobi emerged the victor and Vader was left limbless and burnt on the banks of a volcanic river. Forced to live in a life-supporting armored suit as a result of his injuries, upon learning of the death of his wife, he continued to serve Sidious as his apprentice and chief enforcer. Under the new Imperial regime, alongside his master and Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, Vader ruthlessly put down any rebellion against the new Empire. He also trained the Inquisitorius to hunt down any remaining Jedi and retrieve any newborn Force-sensitives per his master's will.
											<br><br>
											Almost two decades after his turn to the dark side, the various rebel groups who opposed the tyrannical rule of the Galactic Empire had united to form the Alliance to Restore the Republic and destroyed the Death Star, a superweapon that was meant to cement the Emperor's supreme rule over the galaxy. As the sole survivor of the Empire's stunning defeat at the Battle of Yavin, Vader was blamed and found himself pitted against several potential replacements vying to become the Emperor's new apprentice. In the meantime, he uncovered that the Force-sensitive pilot who was responsible for the destruction of the Death Star was his son, Luke Skywalker, whom Amidala had given birth to before she passed away and whom Kenobi had hidden on the one planet he knew would Vader never return to, Tatooine.
											<br><br>
											Now aware of the Emperor's deception, Vader drew young Skywalker out and attempted to sway him into joining him and overthrowing his master: Luke refused, unable to accept the truth. As the Galactic Civil War culminated at the Battle of Endor, Vader fought Skywalker in a final duel aboard the Death Star II, his son now a Jedi Knight set on redeeming him back to the light side. Skywalker defeated his father but refused to kill him, prompting Sidious to attempt to kill the young Jedi; witnessing this, Vader abandoned the dark side and sacrificed himself to destroy the Emperor, fulfilling the prophecy of the Chosen One. Mortally wounded, Anakin Skywalker made peace with his son and became one with the Force.
											<br><br>
											Before he died, Vader learned he also had a daughter, Leia Organa. She subsequently married the smuggler Han Solo and had a son named Ben Solo. From his youth, Ben struggled against his own pull to the dark side of the Force and, upon learning the truth of his mother's parentage, he became obsessed with his grandfather's legacy. He himself fell to the dark side and became Kylo Ren, master of the Knights of Ren and apprentice to Snoke, the Supreme Leader of the First Order—the successor to the Galactic Empire.

										<h2>Chewbacca</h2>
										<p>
											<img src="assets/images/chew.PNG" width="80%" height="80%">
											<br>Chewbacca, known affectionately to his friends as Chewie, was a Wookiee warrior, smuggler, and resistance fighter who fought in the Clone Wars, the Galactic Civil War, and the conflict between the First Order and the Resistance. He hailed from the planet Kashyyyk and became a Wookiee military leader. During the Clone Wars, he was captured by Trandoshan slavers and held captive on Wasskah, but he worked with a fellow captive, Jedi Commander Ahsoka Tano, to escape. He later commanded Wookiee forces during the Battle of Kashyyyk alongside the Grand Army of the Republic, led by Jedi Master Yoda. During the battle, one of the last ones of the war, Yoda's clone troopers received Order 66 from Supreme Chancellor Palpatine and, with the help of Chewbacca, Yoda escaped Kashyyyk and the destruction of the Jedi Order.
											<br><br>
											In the years that followed, during the rule of the Galactic Empire, Chewbacca became a smuggler and the co-pilot of Captain Han Solo aboard the Millennium Falcon. They worked in the employ of crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure until Solo was forced to dump a shipment of spice to avoid trouble with the Empire, at which point a bounty was placed on their heads. Soon thereafter, Chewbacca and Solo were hired by Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi to ferry him, Luke Skywalker, C-3PO, and R2-D2 to Alderaan on a mission vital to the survival of the Alliance to Restore the Republic. After finding Alderaan was destroyed, the group was brought aboard the Death Star, where they helped Princess Leia Organa escape from captivity and return to the Rebel base on Yavin 4. Though Chewbacca and Solo initially chose to leave Yavin 4 and not join the Rebellion, they ended up fighting in the Battle of Yavin and were instrumental in Skywalker's destruction of the Death Star, a major victory for the Rebellion.
											<br><br>
											Throughout the war, Chewbacca and Solo fought the Empire in a number of engagements, including an assault on Cymoon 1 and the battle on Vrogas Vas. Along with Princess Organa and C-3PO, they escaped from Echo Base on the planet Hoth after the Empire tracked the Rebel Alliance there. The group sought refuge with Lando Calrissian, an old friend of Solo's, on Cloud City, but Calrissian betrayed them and turned them over to Darth Vader, the Emperor's chief enforcer, after his city was threatened. Solo was frozen in carbonite and Calrissian helped the others escape, but they were too late to save the frozen Solo from being taken by Boba Fett to Jabba the Hutt. Chewbacca and Calrissian set off to find Solo and located him in Jabba's Palace on Tatooine, where Chewbacca and his friends saved Solo and destroyed Jabba. Shortly thereafter, they fought in the Battle of Endor, where Chewbacca helped destroy the shield generator and allowed the Alliance Fleet to destroy the Death Star II. The Emperor was killed aboard the battle station, delivering a crippling blow to the Empire.
											<br><br>
											After Endor and the rise of the New Republic, Chewbacca and Solo fought to liberate Kashyyyk from the Empire. When the war finally came to a close, Chewbacca returned home to Kashyyyk with his family. After Solo's son Ben, turned to the dark side and destroyed Skywalker's new generation of Jedi, Chewbacca reunited with his old friend and the two spent many years as smugglers once more. They lost the Millennium Falcon and ended up smuggling aboard a ship called the Eravana, but they eventually found the Falcon and, with it, stowaways named Rey, Finn, and the droid BB-8. The droid had part of a map that led to the exiled Luke Skywalker, so the group brought the map to the Resistance that opposed the First Order, which had risen from the ashes of the Galactic Empire. Chewbacca soon fought in the assault to destroy Starkiller Base, a devastating First Order superweapon, a conflict in which Solo lost his life at the hands of his son. After the base was destroyed, Chewbacca joined Rey in traveling to the planet Ahch-To, where she found Luke Skywalker

										<h2>Darth Maul</h2>
										<p>
											<img src="assets/images/darthmal.PNG" width="80%" height="80%">
											<br>Maul was a Dathomirian Zabrak male who lived during the waning days of the Galactic Republic and the reign of the Galactic Empire. The son of Mother Talzin of the Nightsisters, he was taken as the Sith apprentice of Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith, and given the name Darth Maul. After revealing the existence of the Sith to the Jedi Order, Maul supposedly fell in a lightsaber duel against Obi-Wan Kenobi during the Battle of Naboo. Over a decade later, he returned from exile and formed the criminal army known as the Shadow Collective, intent on reclaiming the power he had lost. His quest for revenge against Kenobi and the Sith continued into the Imperial age, bringing him into conflict with the early rebellion against the Empire.
											<br><br>
											As a Sith Lord, Maul believed it was his destiny to rule the galaxy and bring about the end of the Jedi and the Republic. After the Battle of Naboo, that destiny was taken by Count Dooku, a former Jedi Master who became Sidious' new apprentice. The Sith's war to destroy the Republic began without Maul, as the Clone Wars raged across the galaxy, but Maul returned during the conflict and brought the Shadow Collective together to destroy his enemies and regain what he had lost. He led the takeover of the planet Mandalore with the help of his allies, the Mandalorian splinter group Death Watch, and killed Duchess Satine Kryze as part of his revenge against Kenobi, as she was an old friend and romantic interest of the venerable Jedi Master. Maul was captured and imprisoned by Sidious soon thereafter, who used his former apprentice as part of a plot to eliminate Mother Talzin, whom Sidious considered a threat to his future rule of the galaxy.
											<br><br>
											Sidious succeeded in destroying the Jedi at the end of the war, and he transformed the Republic into the Galactic Empire and proclaimed himself Emperor. During the Empire's reign, Maul dwelled on the ancient Sith world of Malachor after his ship crash-landed there in the hopes of unlocking the superweapon at the heart of the Sith temple. It was his hope that he could use the temple to destroy Sidious and his apprentice, Darth Vader—whom Maul viewed as the embodiment of everything he could have been. Maul's plan was thwarted by two Jedi, Kanan Jarrus and Ezra Bridger, the latter of whom Maul hoped to corrupt as his own apprentice.
											<br><br>
											Later, Maul kidnapped Kanan and Ezra's rebel comrades. He also obtained Ezra's Sith holocron and Kanan Jarrus' holocron through which he learnt that his nemesis Obi-Wan Kenobi was still alive. Maul's efforts to recruit Ezra as his apprentice failed when the young man refused to abandon his friends following a skirmish on Dathomir. Seeking to find hope and purpose, Maul sought out Kenobi on the desert planet of Tatooine. Following a duel, Maul was ultimately killed by Kenobi; ending his quest for vengeance, and finding a sense of peace in the knowledge that the end of the Sith was at hand.

										<h2>Obi-Wan Kenobi</h2>
										<p>
											<img src="assets/images/obi.png" width="35%" height="35%">
											<br>Obi-Wan Kenobi, later known as Ben Kenobi during his exile, was a Force-sensitive human male Jedi Master who served the Galactic Republic. He was mentor to both Anakin Skywalker and his son, Luke, training them in the ways of the Force.
											<br><br>
											Born on the planet Stewjon, Kenobi was taken as the Padawan learner of Qui-Gon Jinn. Kenobi became the first Jedi in a millennium to defeat a Sith Lord when he defeated Darth Maul during the Battle of Naboo. During the battle, Jinn was mortally wounded by Maul, and perished in Kenobi's arms. At Jinn's behest, Kenobi took Anakin Skywalker to be his own Padawan, training him during the decade leading up to the Clone Wars.
											<br><br>
											During the Clone Wars, Skywalker was made a Jedi Knight while Kenobi (as a result of his military successes in the Outer Rim) was granted the title of Master and named to the Jedi Council. The two Jedi fought alongside each other as generals many times. In the last days of the Clone Wars, Skywalker turned to the dark side, betraying the Jedi. Skywalker's new Sith Master, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, used Order 66 to destroy the Jedi Order, though Kenobi survived and reunited with another survivor, Grand Master Yoda. Kenobi confronted Skywalker, who had now taken the name Darth Vader, on Mustafar, and the two dueled. Kenobi emerged the victor, gravely wounding Vader and remorsefully leaving him for dead. However, as Palpatine established the Galactic Empire in place of the Galactic Republic, Vader was rehabilitated, though he was forced to rely on a cybernetic suit for life support. Kenobi went into exile on Tatooine, where he would watch over Vader's newborn son, Luke Skywalker, who he took to live with his aunt and uncle, Beru and Owen Lars.
											<br><br>
											Seventeen years later, he eventually confronted his old enemy Maul, who he again defeated in a brief duel. As the former Sith lay dying in Kenobi's arms, the two finally made peace, and Maul stated that Luke would avenge them both.
											<br><br>
											Two years after the death of Maul, Kenobi received a message via R2-D2 from Leia Organa asking for help in the Rebel Alliance's fight against the Empire. The droid contained the plans to the Death Star, a battle station created by the Empire capable of destroying planets, and the plans needed to be taken to Bail Organa on Alderaan. After Luke Skywalker's aunt and uncle were killed by Imperial forces searching for the plans, Skywalker agreed to join Kenobi on this mission and be trained as a Jedi. The pair were taken to Alderaan by Han Solo, only for them to discover that the planet had been destroyed by the Death Star. Their ship, the Millennium Falcon, was captured by the Death Star's tractor beam, and Kenobi was confronted by Darth Vader. Vader and Kenobi dueled again, and Kenobi allowed Vader to kill him so that Luke and his companions could escape the Death Star.
											<br><br>
											In the following years, as Luke continued fighting for the Rebel Alliance, Kenobi continued to give him guidance as a Force spirit, including directing Luke to the planet Dagobah, where Luke received training from one of Obi-Wan's Masters, Yoda.

										<h2>Ezra Bridger</h2>
										<p>
											<img src="assets/images/ezra.png" width="50%" height="50%">
											<br> Ezra Bridger was a human male Jedi Padawan who became a rebel fighter and revolutionary leader in the early rebellion against the Galactic Empire. He was born to Ephraim and Mira Bridger, whose public criticism of the Empire led to their imprisonment, leaving Bridger an orphan on the planet Lothal as a child. He joined the rebel crew of the Ghost in 5 BBY and became the Jedi apprentice of Kanan Jarrus. Bridger's abilities grew quickly, and a message of hope he broadcasted in the Lothal sector inspired a number of rebel cells to begin working together to fight the Empire.
											<br><br>
											In 4 BBY, Bridger learned that his parents were killed attempting to escape from prison. The young Jedi, already having struggled with his dark side, became more conflicted, coming to a head on the ancient Sith world of Malachor where he recovered a Sith holocron in the hopes of destroying the Sith. He also encountered Darth Maul, who hoped to make Bridger his apprentice—particularly once Bridger used the dark side to open the holocron. This briefly strained his apprenticeship with Jarrus, who was blinded by Maul on Malachor, but the two repaired their relationship and continued to progress as Jedi.
											<br><br>
											With his powers growing stronger, Bridger took on more leadership roles in the rebellion, including helping Clone Captain and rebel mentor CT-7567 ("Rex") and a surviving battalion of Separatist Alliance battle droids make peace and bring a sense of closure to the unresolved Clone Wars. Bridger also came into conflict with Grand Admiral Thrawn, helped fellow crewmate Sabine Wren in her quest to reunite the Mandalorian people, and sought to find Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, whom Bridger believed was key to destroying the Sith.

										<h2>Kanan Jarrus</h2>
										<p>
											<img src="assets/images/kanan.png" width="80%" height="80%">
											<br>Kanan Jarrus, born Caleb Dume, was a Force-sensitive human male Jedi Knight who survived Order 66 during the Clone Wars. Living on thanks to the sacrifice of his master, Depa Billaba, on Kaller, he met the smuggler Janus Kasmir, who taught him how to survive as a fugitive. Going into hiding, he forsook the Jedi ways for some time, swapping his blue-bladed lightsaber for a blaster.
											<br><br>
											Eventually, Jarrus would wind up as a freighter pilot for the corporation Moonglow Polychemical in the Gorse system, piloting Moonglow-72. After getting caught up with a ragtag rebellious group consisting of Twi'lek pilot, Hera Syndulla, the conspiracy theorist Skelly, and the Sullustan shift leader Zaluna Myder, Kanan helped prevent Count Denetrius Vidian from destroying Cynda. During the conflict, Jarrus made the decision to accompany Syndulla on her VCX-100 light freighter, the Ghost—which he eventually would command alongside her. Later on, he would develop a romantic relationship with Syndulla.
											<br><br>
											While cocky and often sarcastic, Jarrus was eager to fight the Galactic Empire. Five years before the Battle of Yavin, Jarrus met Ezra Bridger, a fourteen-year-old Force-sensitive human, whom he decided to mentor and teach as his padawan. After defeating the Grand Inquisitor in combat, Kanan and his fellow rebels learned they were part of a larger rebellion. Kanan and his fellow Spectres joined the Phoenix Squadron. During that time, Kanan developed an enduring friendship with the former Clone Captain Rex. While helping the rebellion, Kanan and Ezra also fought with two Inquisitors known as the Fifth Brother and the Seventh Sister.
											<br><br>
											After the discover of Chopper Base, Kanan and his apprentice, accompanied by Ahsoka Tano, would travel to the planet Malachor to learn about the Sith. However, this decision would have costly results, as Kanan would be rendered blind by a lightsaber strike from the former Sith Lord Maul at a Sith temple on the planet. After months of retreat, Kanan restored his connection to the Force and repaired his frayed relationship with Ezra with the help of a mysterious being called Bendu, who embodied the balance between the light and dark sides of the Force. Despite his blindness, Kanan would come to see things through the Force.
											<br><br>
											The reinvigorated Kanan and his fellow rebels would continue fighting the Empire, which dispatched a tactician named Grand Admiral Thrawn to deal with the rebellion. In addition, Kanan and Ezra also had to deal with the spectre of Maul, who sought to destroy Obi-Wan Kenobi, the key to destroying the Sith. Regaining his confidence, Kanan also trained the Mandalorian rebel Sabine Wren on how to wield the Darksaber with the hope of using her to rally the Mandalorians over to the rebel cause.

										<h2>Akosha Tano</h2>
										<p>
											<img src="assets/images/akosha.png" width="80%" height="80%">
											<br> Ahsoka Tano, nicknamed Snips by her master, was a Togruta female from the planet Shili who trained as a Jedi apprentice during the Clone Wars, the conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Tano was assigned to Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker by Jedi Grand Master Yoda, and she demonstrated an eagerness to prove herself worthy to be his apprentice. Tano was involved in the defeat of the Separatist army on the planet Christophsis and was important to Republic efforts during the Battle of Teth. Along with Skywalker, Tano was instrumental in acquiring the Republic's safe passage through Hutt Space, due to her part in rescuing the son of Jabba the Hutt, which ensured an alliance between the Republic and the Hutt clans.
											<br><br>
											Later, Tano and her master achieved many things during the war including stopping the Blue Shadow Virus, freeing Togruta slaves from Kiros, saving her Master and many others on multiple occasions, and even halting a plot masterminded by Darth Sidious himself. She also engaged some of most deadly people in the galaxy, most notably Asajj Ventress, General Grievous, and Cad Bane several times, always surviving without any serious injury. Tano had a brief brush with the dark side on Mortis after being infected with it by the Son and even died, but she was resurrected by the Daughter. Tano formed close bonds with many members of the Order, which included Plo Koon, Barriss Offee, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Luminara Unduli as well as people outside the Order such as Padmé Amidala and Lux Bonteri, to whom she developed a romantic attraction.
											<br><br>
											Around 20 BBY, Tano's friend Barriss Offee, who believed the Jedi Order to be evil, and corrupt, and overly belligerent, orchestrated the bombing of the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, killed the bomber, Letta Turmond, and caused the deaths of clone troopers while framing Tano for these crimes. While running away from Republic authorities and Skywalker, who still believed her to be innocent, Tano met her longtime nemesis Asajj Ventress and briefly allied with her, since both were on the run from their masters. Tano was led by Offee, the only Jedi whom she still saw as an ally, into a trap at an abandoned Coruscant warehouse in Coruscant's Undercity, where she was captured by Skywalker's forces. The Jedi High Council then expelled Tano from the Jedi Order and turned her over to the Republic for trial. Tano came very close to a conviction and death sentence, but she was acquitted at the last minute by the forced confession of a captured Offee. While the Council pardoned Tano and offered to bring her back into the Order, Tano refused, and she left the Jedi Temple.

										<h2>Zeb Orrelios</h2>
										<p>
											<img src="assets/images/zeb.png" width="80%" height="80%">
											<br> Garazeb Orrelios, commonly known as Zeb, was a male Lasat rebel who manned the starship Ghost. Prior to joining the Spectres rebel cell, Zeb was a Captain of the Lasan Honor Guard and was trained to fight with a bo-rifle. He was one of the few Lasat to survive the devastation of his homeworld of Lasan and as a result developed a deep hatred towards the Empire. As a member of the Lothal rebel cell led by the Twi'lek Hera Syndulla and the Jedi Kanan Jarrus, Zeb took part in numerous raids and mission against the Empire. While temperamental and volatile, Zeb was compassionate and had a strong moral compass.
											<br><br>
											Zeb was affected by the trauma of witnessing the destruction of his homeworld Lasan. Despite his skepticism towards spiritual matters, Zeb took a leap of faith when he at the urging of his fellow Lasat compatriots Chava and Gron used his bo-rifle to guide the Ghost through a collapsed star cluster to the original Lasat homeworld of Lira San. Zeb regained his confidence by discovering that he was not the last Lasat. Later, Zeb developed an unlikely friendship with his nominal enemy the Imperial Security Bureau Agent Kallus when the two were forced to work together to survive on the icy moon of Bahryn. Due to Zeb's friendship, Kallus was forced to appraise his views of the rebellion and later became the rebel informant known as Fulcrum.
											<br><br>
											After learning they were part of a larger rebel network, Zeb and his fellow rebels would continue fighting against threats such as Darth Vader, the Inquisitors, the former Sith Maul, and Grand Admiral Thrawn. At times, Zeb and his fellow rebels worked with criminal elements such as the pirate Hondo Ohnaka and the crime lord Azmorigan. While Zeb did not get on with the droids Chopper and AP-5, the three gained a better respect for each other when they joined forces to defeat the E-XD infiltrator droid EXD-9. AP-5 and Chopper came to appreciate Zeb's brawn while Zeb came to respect AP-5's talents and Chopper's guile.

										<h2>Sabine Wren</h2>
										<p>
											<img src="assets/images/sabine.png" width="80%" height="80%">
											<br> Sabine Wren was a human female Mandalorian warrior and revolutionary leader during the early rebellion against the Galactic Empire. Her artistry during the rebellion inspired the symbol of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, and her claim over the ancient Mandalorian weapon known as the Darksaber made her a symbol to Clan Wren and the hopes of freeing her homeworld of Mandalore from the rule of the Empire.
											<br><br>
											Prior to becoming a rebel, Wren was a cadet at the Imperial Academy of Mandalore. She built weapons she believed would be used for peace but were instead used against her family and her people. Wracked with guilt, Wren left Mandalore and was branded a traitor by the Empire and her mother, Ursa Wren, leader of the clan. Wren worked as a bounty hunter alongside her friend Ketsu Onyo before being recruited by Captain Hera Syndulla and the Jedi Kanan Jarrus to join their rebel crew aboard the starship Ghost. Together, the crew fought against the Empire and used Wren's art as a symbol of hope. They became part of a larger rebel movement, with Wren's work continuing to inspire the fledgling rebellion.
											<br><br>
											In 2 BBY, while hunting down the former Sith Lord and Mandalorian ruler Darth Maul, Wren discovered the Darksaber on Dathomir. She initially wanted nothing to do with it, but Jarrus and Fenn Rau, a Mandalorian Protector of Concord Dawn who joined the rebellion, convinced her to wield it so she could unite the Mandalorian people and bring them into the rebellion. Wren returned to her family and convinced them of the Empire's treachery, helping to kill Gar Saxon, the Imperial Viceroy of Mandalore, in the process. Though her friends left to return to the rebellion, Wren remained with her family so she could find a way to free Mandalore.
